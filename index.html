Glad you stumbled on my little corner of the internet. My name is Robert- but my friends call me Robbie. I'm a 17-year-old student based in Bellingham, WA. I consider myself a bit of a "Jack of all trades," and like to dabble and excel in many different fields. I'm a full-stack developer, engineer, machinist, mechanic, filmmaker, a/v technician, director, and broadcast engineer, just to name a few. I'm a technical-minded individual with a passion for creating and building things. I Enjoy being pragmatic in my work, with some room for creativity on top. I'm always looking for new projects to work on, so if you have something in mind, feel free to <a href="#c">reach out!</a></p></div></div></section><h1 class="more" id="k">what i do</h1><p class="more noselect">...</p><section class="skills"><div class="slider"><section class="bubbles" id="bubbles"><a id="a" class="av bubble" href="#s-1"><h2>audio/visual work</h2></a><a id="p" class="code bubble" href="#s-2"><h2>code</h2></a><a id="g" class="make bubble" href="#s-3"><h2>make things</h2></a></section><div class="slides"><div id="s-1" class="slide-av"><div class="grid-header">Film</div><div class="grid-header">Broadcast</div><div class="grid-header">Events</div><div class="grid-header">Theater</div><div><p>While I may be new to the film world, my lifelong experience in other a/v fields has proven to be incredibly useful. I've worked on a few short films now, and have experience in all aspects of production, from pre-production to post.</p></div><div><p>I Have a good few years of broadcast experience under my belt, and have worked on a great many live broadcasts. Much of my most intensive work has been in the sports world. I particularly enjoy directing and technical directing, but enjoy being a versatile member on any crew, and implementing new technologies and workflows.</p></div><div><p>Much of my experience comes from the events world, going all the way back to middle school, where I directed the a/v elements (audio mixing, lighting) of our school's assemblies and talent show. In more recent years, I've been lucky enough to continue my work in this field, running sound and visuals for a variety of events.</p></div><div><p>Theater happens to be my "last frontier" in the a/v world. I've only been in the sphere for a short period of time, however I've been able to pick up the ropes quickly- I Even own my own lighting equipment to practice programming on.</p></div><div class="grid-img noselect"><img src="img/shot2.png" alt="an image of a film set"/></div><div class="grid-img noselect"><img src="img/TMP_Broadcast.jpg" alt="an image of a broadcast booth"/></div><div class="grid-img noselect"><img src="img/TMP_mixer.jpg" alt="an image of an audio mixer"/></div><div class="grid-img noselect"><img src="img/forest.jpg" alt="an image of a theater"/></div></div><div id="s-2" class="slide-code"><div class="code-decor"></div><div class="code-explainer"><h1>programming</h1><p>Has been a lifelong passion of mine, going all the way back to second grade. I've worked on a variety of projects, from web development to game development. I'm a full-stack developer, with experience in a variety of web frameworks, including SvelteKit, React, Next.js, and more. However, I also enjoy working on vanilla projects, such as the site you're on right now! In fact, this site was built with pure HTML and raw CSS, excluding JavaScript completely. I'm also experienced in a variety of languages, my full list containing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C#, C++, Rust, Java, Kotlin, and more.
